        <p>Mohamed Fakhreddine created Deliberate Assembly after repeatedly witnessing motivated and well-intentioned people
        coming together to form activist groups and then falling out over decisions and governance.</p>
        <p>The mission of Deliberate Assembly is to unite people around the world using the same procedures used to run orderly and
        deliberative assemblies, from your local Rotary Club to the United States Congress.</p>
        <p>Give it a try now!</p>
